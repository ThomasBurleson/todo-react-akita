# TodoMVC (React) using Facades + Akita

## Introduction

React solutions using Redux are often complex and difficult to maintain. Developers can use RxJS to build _push-based_ APIs... and create clean, easily understood, easily maintained architectures.

For a deep-dive into the architecture and considerations, read [React Facades - Best Practices](https://thomasburlesonia.medium.com/react-facade-best-practices-1c8186d8495a)

## Todo MVC

Let's create a simple Todo application written in React + TypeScript. This application is architected using react hooks, facades, RxJS, and Akita state management. With Akita, we also get powerful undo/redo features.

This project was created with `npx create-react-app todo-akita --template typescript`

## Why Facades + Akita + RxJS

When our `todos` and `filter` state changes, we need to trigger UI re-renders (to show the currents states values for those properties/state.

I could have used MobX to provide notifications to state changes, instead I am using RxJS to expose the state and long-lived streams. To keep our code super clean, we use a special hook to subscribe to the RxJS observables/streams: `useObservable()`.

The `useObservable()` hook will emit the current state values whenever the stream emits updated, changed values. Even better - using `useObservable` within the custom hook `useTodosHook` - I am able to hide all details of RxJS use and subscription management.

Note that I also use:

- Akita to manage state collection data (list of Todo items), and
- Facade pattern to encapsulate the use of Akita and expose a clean API + 'smart' view model for the UI components.

## Benefits

Implementing distinct business layers (using Facades and Hooks) has myrida benefits:

- encourages 1-way data flows,
- promotes the use of **Presentation** components,
- enables UI-independent testing of the business layer(s).

### 1-way Data flows

The benefits of using hooks + **facades** is a super clean view layer AND event delegation to the facade. This maintains a 1-way data flow.

- The view components delegate user interactions to the Facade.
- The view components render data output from the Facade.
- The custom hook `useTodosHook()` hides the Facade's use of RxJS streams.
- The Facade pushes data updates/changes to the view using **RxJS streams**

<br/>

### Super-Clean UI Components

With facades ( + hooks), the UI components do not have any business logic, state management, nor data persistance.

This also means that the TodosPage is using presentational children components. Each child component output events to the parent business container `TodoPages`; which - in turn - delegates directly to Facade methods.

### Super easy Testing

The best way to test an application is use a layered-testing approach:

- Use **Jest** for rigorous testing of all non-UI components: the business and data-service layers
- Use **Cypress** for UI and user-interaction testing.

<br/>

#### Jest Testing

<br/>

If we consider the business and data-access layers the 'engine' for our application, then we should be able to easily change the UI if the engine is fully tested and stable.

For our business layers we have three (3) major components:

- TodosStore + TodosQuery (Akita State Management)
- TodosFacade: API and properties (RxJS streams)
- TodosHook: Custom React Hook (UI Component State + Rendering)

The **MORE** rigorous our testing of the business layer, the **MORE** confident we become regarding the data flows and core of the application. In our current scenario:

- the Store and Query do NOT need be tested; as the logic is super simple.
- the **Facade** and **Hook** will, however, be extensively tested.

<br/>

#### Testing with RxJS Streams

<br/>

Our `TodosFacade` has two (2) published streams: `todos$` and `filter$`. We will use an RxJS utility `readFirst()` to extract a single value from the stream.

```ts
it('instance shouild be initialized properly', async () => {
  const facade = makeFacade();

  expect(facade).not.toBeNull();

  const todos = await readFirst(facade.todos$);
  const filter = await readFirst(facade.filter$);

  expect(todos.length).toBe(0);
  expect(filter).toBe(VISIBILITY_FILTER.SHOW_ALL);
  expect(facade.history).not.toBeNull();
});
```

ðŸ‘‰ @see [todos.facade.spec.ts](./src/state/todos.facade.spec.ts)

<br/>

#### Testing React Hooks

<br/>

The nature of React Hooks requires testing to be performed in the context of a UI component. Let's use `@testing-library/react-hooks` to make our testing clean and succinct.

Let's use `renderHook()` to get access to the mutable response from the custom hook. And we will also use the `act()` utility to encapsulate and perform 1..n actions that trigger hooks and UI updates.

```ts
it('should emit updated todos after addTodo()', () => {
  const { hookResponse } = renderHook(useTodosHook);

  const facade = (): TodosFacade => hookResponse.current[2];
  const todos = (): Todo[] => hookResponse.current[1];
  const filter = (): VISIBILITY_FILTER => hookResponse.current[0] as VISIBILITY_FILTER;

  expect(facade()).toBeTruthy();
  expect(todos().length).toBe(0);
  expect(filter()).toEqual(VISIBILITY_FILTER.SHOW_ALL);

  act(() => {
    facade().addTodo('Task 1');
    facade().addTodo('Task 2');
  });

  expect(todos().length).toBe(2);
});
```

Recall that our custom hook `useTodosHook` returns a Tuple response:

```ts
export type TodoHookTuple = [string, Todo[], TodosFacade];
```

To simplify access within the response Tuple object, I create accessor functions (eg `filter()`) to the actual properties values.

ðŸ‘‰ @see [todos.hook.spec.ts](./src/state/todos.hook.spec.ts)

Testing hooks is now super easy, clean, and fun!

### Immutability

Great architectures with 1-way data flows must use immutable data to centralize state changes into a single area. Using **ImmerJS** to emit immutable data outputs and enable easy mutations inside the Facade or Store.

Use the `produce()` function to simultaneously mutate data and return an updated, immutable object.

```ts
import { produce } from 'immer';

export class TodosFacade {
  constructor(private store: TodosStore, private query: TodosQuery) {}

  updateFilter(filter: VISIBILITY_FILTER) {
    this.store.update(
      produce((draft: TodosState) => {
        draft.filter = filter;
      })
    );
  }
}
```
